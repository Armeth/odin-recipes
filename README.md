"The current project seems to be a recipe book of some sort. I have been learning more about the terminal and its commands than actual html so far. Did a lot of my own research on how to do a few things like moving files around, something I had to realize is that the files I manipulate are not objects in and of themselves but rather I am using "data" within a existing framework. I do not move files, I tell the computer to use this "data" here, and then that "data" over there. Perhaps by "data" I mean array or disk addresses or somesuch. Ok, enough, let's build something. A quick edit."



Well that was fun, I may have gotten a little carried away, added a few flouishes here and there. I learned alot about css from just playing around and googling different things when I wanted to do something but didn't know how. That starry background was one such thing.
